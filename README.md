# DidactiCAD 

## Overview

Welcome to DidactiCAD (Computer Aided Drawing) - An application designed to explore the process development of computer-aided design with a focus on a software renderer. This application provides a platform for users to create and visualize digital drawings, schematics, and designs in an intuitive and user-friendly environment.  From the Greek *didactikos* meaning "pertaining to teaching or instruction", DidactiCAD was built to explore the process of application development without the use of any supporting software or dependencies.

## Features
