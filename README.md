# SketchyCAD 

## Overview

Welcome to SketchyCAD (Computer Aided Drawing) - An application designed to explore the process development of computer-aided design with a focus on a software renderer. This application provides a platform for users to create and visualize digital drawings, schematics, and designs in an intuitive and user-friendly environment.  SketchyCAD was built to explore the process of application development without the use of any supporting software or dependencies.  Although not intended for practical use, the development of SketchyCAD proved to be a challenging and rewarding endeavor resulting in software Ã  la the later 1980s.

## Features

### 1. Software Renderer

This CAD application comes equipped with a software renderer that allows users to create detailed 2D renderings of their designs. The renderer supports various rendering techniques including vector graphics and text and font rendering.

### 2. Interactive User Interface

The user interface is designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind. Users can easily access drawing tools and a command line interface to streamline their drafting process. The goal is to provide a smooth and enjoyable experience.

### 3. Drawing Tools

CAD offers a simple but comprehensive set of drawing tools, including lines, shapes, text, and measurement tools. These tools are designed to facilitate precision and flexibility, enabling users to create intricate designs with ease.
